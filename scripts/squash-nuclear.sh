# The nuclear squashing option. This script creates a binary diff (to capture image files etc) between develop and the
# current branch. Then it will create a new branch based off that diff, add all the file changes to git in the current
# directory, commit them and push everything to the server as a new branch under the same name with -squashed appended
# to the branch name. If you do not want all files in the web directory added, try the squash-advanced.sh script
# instead.
#
# How to use:
#
# First update your local copy of develop and merge that into your branch e.g.:
# git checkout develop
# git pull
# git checkout your-branch
# git merge develop (and fix any conflicts)
# git commit (retain any history about conflicts and the fixes)
# git push
#
# Now run this script e.g. ./scripts/squash-nuclear.sh.


# Change to the path of this script, then go up a level to the main web directory. This allows the script to be
# executed from multiple places and still capture all the code changes in the main web directory. E.g. if executed via
# ./scripts/squash-nuclear.sh or cd scripts && ./squash-nuclear.sh they will both work.
